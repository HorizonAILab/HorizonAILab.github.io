<font color=red>I am currently recruiting self-motivated PhD and MPhil students. Please carefully read the following contents before sending me an E-mail:</font>

### Opening Positions
- There are opening research positions in my group at all levels, including Postdoc, research assistant, Ph.D. student, and master student. Please send me an E-mail which contains your CV, score sheet, certificates, and representative publications if you are interested.

- I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate students (mainly @NUDT) to join my group for research training!

### Prospective students

I am currently recruiting self-motivated PhD and MPhil students to join our group. Please carefully read the following contents before sending me an E-mail:

**Research interests**: I mainly study how to design advanced machine learning algorithms using mathematical tools, which can be further applied to computer vision, data mining, and other fields. Recent research interests include weakly supervised learning (e.g., semi-supervised learning, label noise robust learning, PU learning, partial label learning, etc.), interactive machine learning (curriculum learning, machine teaching, etc.).

**Admission expectations**: I prefer the students who have solid mathematical foundations, strong programming skills, and good English abilities (listening/speaking/reading/writing). The experiences in research (e.g. academic competition, publications, extracurricular academic activities, etc.) will be a benefit. Besides, I also recommend you take [Machine Learning Course instructed by Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_ML20.html) (or at least one of pattern recognition or computer vision classes) before getting into machine learning research.

**Training objectives**: 1) After carefully organized scientific research training, the students are expected to gain solid professional knowledge, rigorous scientific thinking, strong practical ability, broad academic vision, and important scientific literacy for independent problem discovery, thinking, and solving; 2)Publish high-level and impactful papers in top journals or conferences, and is interested in continuing academic research after graduation.

**My promise**: 1) Since I have always been in the frontline of scientific research, I will provide you a full range of effective guidance in algorithm design, coding, experimental verification, paper writing, patent application, presentation, etc. 2) Provide you enjoyable scientific research atmosphere, comfortable research environment, generous allowance/rewards, and efficient computing equipment; 3) I will not let you deal with administrative affairs that are not related to your research, so as to ensure that you have sufficient time for your research; 4) For the students who succesfully get their papers accepted by top conferences, I will try my best to financially support them to participate in the conferences; 5) For outstanding PhD students, I will provide a joint training opportunity with overseas universities with a duration of 0.5-2 years; 6) For outstanding graduates, I would be happy to write recommendation letters for job hunting or university application.

(本人每年在计算机科学与技术领域招收 4-7 名研究生和 3-5 名本科生（ESI 排名前 0.1%）。欢迎对人工智能理论与应用、计算智能、三维视觉、机器学习、深度学习和计算机视觉感兴趣的学生联系和咨询。此外，我的研究团队还有几个研究生职位空缺。欢迎加入我们！)

### Team Lab Research Profile(团队实验室科研情况简介)

Three-dimensional visual channel is one of the important ways for human brain to obtain information. Three-dimensional vision technology, which is centered on scene analysis and perception and understanding in three-dimensional space, is one of the important research directions of the new generation of artificial intelligence frontiers. We live in three-dimensional space, so how to intelligently perceive and explore the external environment has been a hot topic. Two-dimensional vision technology has achieved beyond human cognition with the help of powerful computer vision and deep learning algorithms, but three-dimensional vision still faces problems such as algorithmic modeling and environment dependence, and has been at the forefront of ongoing research. However, 3D information can reflect the state of objects and environment more realistically and is closer to human perception mode. In recent years, our lab team has been developing rapidly based on the Key Laboratory of Collaborative Intelligent Systems of the Ministry of Education, Xidian University. Based on the core technology of artificial intelligence, the team has launched scientific research in the field of 3D vision, focusing on solving its core problems such as scene analysis, semantic understanding, and collaborative optimization. In the process, the team has achieved a series of scientific research results with international influence. Our team publishes more than 20 papers every year in top international journals and conferences, such as IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TVCG, IEEE TEVC, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR.(三维视觉通道是人类大脑获取信息的重要途径之一。以三维空间的场景分析与感知理解为核心的三维视觉技术，是新一代人工智能前沿的重要研究方向之一。我们生活在三维空间中，因此如何智能地感知和探索外部环境一直是个热点课题。二维视觉技术借助强大的计算机视觉和深度学习算法取得了超越人类认知的成就，但三维视觉仍然面临着算法建模和环境依赖等问题，一直处于正在研究的前沿。然而，三维信息能够更真实地反映物体和环境的状态，也更接近人类的感知模式。近年来，我们的实验室团队依托西安电子科技大学协同智能系统教育部重点实验室快速发展。以人工智能核心技术为基础，团队在三维视觉领域展开科学研究，着重解决其场景分析、语义理解、协同优化等核心问题。在此过程中，团队取得了一系列具有国际影响力的科研成果。我们的团队每年在IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TVCG, IEEE TEVC, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR等国际顶级期刊和会议上发表论文20余篇。)

### Requirements for Admission of PhD Students(招收博士生要求)

The MSc students in our team have all demonstrated strong research capabilities, and many of them aspire to be promoted to PhD in their second year. However, due to the scarcity and preciousness of PhD places, we have to face the reality that even outstanding students who have published as first author in top international journals or conferences may not be able to secure a PhD place in our team. For applicants from outside universities who are interested in joining our team to pursue a PhD degree, we have set a clear criterion: at least one paper published as the first author in international conferences or journals recognized as Class A by the China Computer Federation or in the first division by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We have also set a requirement that all applicants from outside universities should have a PhD degree in a top international journal or conference. This requirement aims to ensure that our team's PhD cohort consists of members with outstanding research capabilities. If you meet the above criteria and are eager to join our research team, we encourage you to get in touch with us as soon as possible. We offer PhD students a generous package and a wealth of resources to support your academic development and professional growth. We are looking forward to your joining us to promote the development and progress of the 3D visualization field and explore the boundaries of knowledge! (我们团队的硕士生均展现出较强的研究能力，其中许多人都有志于在第二年晋升为博士生。然而，由于博士名额的稀缺和珍贵，我们不得不面对一个现实：即便是在国际顶级期刊或会议上以第一作者身份发表论文的优秀学生，也可能无法在我们团队获得博士生名额。对于有意加入我们团队攻读博士学位的外校申请者，我们设定了明确的标准：至少在CCF-A或中科院一区的国际学术会议或期刊上以第一作者身份发表过一篇论文。这一要求旨在确保我们团队的博士生队伍由科研能力卓越的成员组成。如果您符合上述条件，并且渴望加入我们的研究团队，我们鼓励您尽快与我们取得联系。我们为博士生提供了优厚的待遇和丰富的资源，以支持您的学术发展和职业成长。我们期待您的加入，共同推动三维视觉领域的发展和进步，探索知识的边界!)
