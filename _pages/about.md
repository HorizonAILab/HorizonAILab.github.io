[Functional Annotation of Human Protein Coding Isoforms via Non-convex Multi-Instance Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9858006), **<font color=navy>ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining</font>**, Halifax, Canada [[PDF]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3097983.3097984)\\

- Functional annotation of human genes is fundamentally important for understanding the molecular basis of various genetic diseases. A major challenge in determining the functions of human genes lies in the functional diversity of proteins, that is, a gene can perform different functions as it may consist of multiple protein coding isoforms (PCIs). However, due to the lack of isoform-level gold-standards (ground-truth annotation), many existing functional annotation approaches are developed at gene-level.
-  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to differentiate the functions of PCIs by integrating sparse simplex projection---that is, a nonconvex sparsity-inducing regularizer---with the framework of multi-instance learning (MIL). Our framework is flexible to incorporate various smooth and non-smooth loss functions such as logistic loss and hinge loss. To solve the resulting highly nontrivial non-convex and non-smooth optimization problem, we further develop an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm. 
- Extensive experiments on human genome data demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of functional annotation accuracy of human PCIs and efficiency.

- In practice, the SGG datasets are often dual imbalanced, presented as a large number of backgrounds and rarely few foregrounds, and highly skewed foreground relationships categories. 
- To reduce its side effect and make the contributions of different categories equally, we propose a novel debiased SGG method (named DSDI) by incorporating biased resistance loss and causal intervention tree.
- To learn more discriminate representation of the foreground by expanding the foreground features space, the biased resistance loss decouples the background classification from foreground relationship recognition. Meanwhile, a causal graph of content and context is designed to learn unbiased relationship features via casual intervention tree.

-  To tackle the double missing of features and labels problem, we propose a novel deep incomplete multi-view learning network (DIMvLN).
- DIMvLN integrates graph neural networks and semi-supervised learning into a unified framework to effectively handle incomplete multi-view data and insufficient label information.
- Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIMvLN in improving the performance of multi-view learning tasks.

- In practice, the naturally skewed label distribution and label dependence contribute to the issue of label imbalance in MIML.
- We propose an imbalanced multi-instance multi-label learning method named IMIMLC, based on the error-correcting coding ensemble and an adaptive threshold strategy. 
- Furthermore, IMIMLC adaptively learns thresholds for each individual label by margin maximization, preventing inaccurate predictions caused by the semantic discrepancy across many labels and their unbalanced ratios.

- We propose a novel Deep Incomplete Multi-View Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Learning method (DIMvSML) for incomplete features and a huge number of unlabeled instances. Specifically, we design the structure-specific deep feature extractors to obtain discriminative information and preserve the cross-view consistency with instance-level contrastive loss. 
- Furthermore, to eliminate the bias of the estimate of the risk of SSL, we design a safe estimate framework with an unbiased loss and improve its empirical performance by pseudo-labels. 
- Besides, we provide both the theoretical proof of better estimate variance and the intuitive explanation of our debiased framework.

- The relationships should be the semantic reflection of interactions between objects, rather than the statistical dependency between categories. 
- We propose a novel Causal Features Enhancement Network (CFEN) to mine the essential semantic features between objects and relationships.
- To measure the influence of object-specific features for relationship recognition, we construct the counterfactual training framework for computing the difference between fact and counterfactual logits.

- We address how LVLMs process visual information and whether this process causes hallucination.
- First, we identify the middle layers are crucial for handling visual data in LVLMs, which can be further divided into two stages: **visual information enrichment** and **semantic refinement**.
- Second, we find that real tokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones, serving as a strong indicator of hallucination.
- Third, we observe that hallucination tokens often result from attention heads interacting with inconsistent objects.

- We propose a theory-inspired Deep Multi-View Multi-Label Learning method with Incomplete Views and Noisy Labels named DMMIvNL, based on the information bottleneck theory.
- Meanwhile, we theoretically prove that minimizing the volume of the transition matrix ensures the statistical consistency with classifier training. 
- Besides, a cycle-consistent estimation is proposed in the volume minimization network to improve the recognition stability of multi-label noise. 
- Moreover, leveraging inherent semantics and label correlations are employed as model regularization to reduce the risk of noise fitting.
